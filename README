This is a python port of the R2 version of Marpa.

See https://github.com/jeffreykegler/Marpa--R2 for the original version.


Conversion Process
==================

The R2.py file is where the c library will get loaded, and the rest of the library gets exposed to the outside world.

The scanless.g interface is the first to get ported. This is the primary code path to follow if you are thinking of helping.
